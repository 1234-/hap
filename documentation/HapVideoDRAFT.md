#Hap Video



##Introduction


Hap is an open video codec. It stores frames in a format that can be decoded in part by dedicated graphics hardware on modern computer systems. The aim of Hap is to enable playback of a greater number of simultaneous streams of higher resolution video than is possible using alternative codecs.


##Scope


This document describes the content of Hap frames. It makes no recommendation on container format or the practical details of implementing an encoder or decoder.


##External References


The correct encoding and decoding of Hap frames depends on compression schemes defined outside of this document. Adherence to these schemes is required to produce conforming Hap frames.

##Hap Frames


A Hap frame is formed of a header of at least four bytes (but possibly more) immediately followed by a frame data section.

###Frame Header

All integers are stored in little-endian byte order.

The header will be at least four bytes in size, and it's total size will depend on the values in the first three bytes, as well as the second-stage compression format (the high order four bits of the fourth byte).

The fourth byte of the header is an unsigned integer denoting the S3 and second-stage compression formats in which the data is stored. Its value and meaning will be one of the following:

|Hexadecimal Byte Value |S3 Format         |Second-Stage Compressor      |
|-----------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|
|0xAB                   |RGB DXT1          |None                         |
|0xBB                   |RGB DXT1          |Snappy                       |
|0xCB                   |RGB DXT1          |Specified by extended header |
|0xAE                   |RGBA DXT5         |None                         |
|0xBE                   |RGBA DXT5         |Snappy                       |
|0xCE                   |RGBA DXT5         |Specified by extended header |
|0xAF                   |Scaled YCoCg DXT5 |None                         |
|0xBF                   |Scaled YCoCg DXT5 |Snappy                       |
|0xCF                   |Scaled YCoCg DXT5 |Specified by extended header |

####If the second-stage compression format is None (OxA) or Snappy (0xB):

The header will be four or eight bytes in size and records the size and format of the frame data. The size of the header is determined by the value of the first three bytes.

When the first three bytes of the header each have the value zero, the header is eight bytes in size. The fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth bytes are an unsigned integer. This is the size of the frame data section in bytes.

When any of the first three bytes of the header have a non-zero value, the header is four bytes in size. The first three bytes are an unsigned integer. This is the size of the frame data section in bytes.

####If the second-stage compression format is 'Specified by extended header' (0xC):

The first three bytes must be 0. Byte four still denotes the S3 and second-stage compression formats. Bytes five through eight are an unsigned integer that denotes the total size of the rest of the packet data in bytes. This data includes both the extended header and the actual frame data. The extended header starts at byte nine and is as follows:
The first 4 bytes are an unsigned integer denoting the total size of the extended header, including any block(s) of extra information required. The actual frame data must start this number of bytes after the extended header's starting byte.
The next 4 bytes are a bitfield of potential options that describe how the frame data is stored. An option may or may not have an extra block of data required to further describe the stored frame data. If such a block is required it will always start with a 4 byte unsigned integer denoting the size of that block. If multiple blocks are present due to multiple options, the order that these blocks appear will be determined by the order that the options are listed in the below table. At least one option must be specified. Options can potentially be mutually exclusive.

|Hexadecimal bit Value |Option                      |
|----------------------|----------------------------|
|0x1                   |Data is partitioned         |

#####Data is partitioned (0x1):

When this option is enabled the frame data has been split up into partitions, each of which will have it's own compression format (or possibly remain uncompressed). Each partition should be decompressed using a seperate call to it's particular decompressor. The block describing the partioning is as laid out as follows:
The first 4 bytes are an unsigned integer denoting the total size of the block in bytes.
The next 4 bytes are an unsigned integer denoting the number of partitions. 
Following those first 8 bytes, there is a table with one entry for each patition. Each entry has 4 4-byte unsigned integers. The first partition will be described by the first 4 integers (16-bytes), the next partition will be described by the 16 bytes immediately following those, and so on. Each entry of 4 integers contain the follow information:

|Integer Index| Value                                   |
--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 0           | The compression format of the partition |
| 1           | The size of the partition               |
| 2           | The uncompressed size of the partition  |
| 3           | Compressor specific information         |

The different compression formats (integer index 0) are defined by these integer values (this is not a bitfield)

| Value             | Compressor          | Compressor specific information entry |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 0x1               | Uncompressed        | Unused, must be 0                     |
| 0x2               | Snappy              | Unused, must be 0                     |

The output position of a partitions data in the final frame can be determined by summing the uncompressed size of all the previous partitions.


###Frame Data


The remainder of the frame is the frame data, starting immediately after the header . The data is to be treated as indicated by the header(s). If a second-stage compressor is indicated then the frame data is to be decompressed accordingly. The result of that decompression will be data in the indicated S3 format. If no second-stage compressor is indicated, the frame data is in the indicated S3 format.

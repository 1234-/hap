#Hap Video



##Introduction


Hap is an open video codec. It stores frames in a format that can be decoded in part by dedicated graphics hardware on modern computer systems. The aim of Hap is to enable playback of a greater number of simultaneous streams of higher resolution video than is possible using alternative codecs.


##Scope


This document describes the content of Hap frames. It makes no recommendation on container format or the practical details of implementing an encoder or decoder.


##External References


The correct encoding and decoding of Hap frames depends on compression schemes defined outside of this document. Adherence to these schemes is required to produce conforming Hap frames.

##Hap Frames


A Hap frame is formed of a header of at least four bytes (but possibly more) immediately followed by a frame data section.

###Frame Header

All integers are stored in little-endian byte order.

The header will be at least four bytes in size, and it's total size will depend on the values in the first three bytes, as well as the second-stage compression format (the high order four bits of the fourth byte).

The fourth byte of the header is an unsigned integer denoting the S3 and second-stage compression formats in which the data is stored. Its value and meaning will be one of the following:

|Hexadecimal Byte Value |S3 Format         |Second-Stage Compressor |
|-----------------------|------------------|------------------------|
|0xAB                   |RGB DXT1          |None                    |
|0xBB                   |RGB DXT1          |Snappy                  |
|0xCB                   |RGB DXT1          |Snappy with options     |
|0xAE                   |RGBA DXT5         |None                    |
|0xBE                   |RGBA DXT5         |Snappy                  |
|0xCE                   |RGBA DXT5         |Snappy with options     |
|0xAF                   |Scaled YCoCg DXT5 |None                    |
|0xBF                   |Scaled YCoCg DXT5 |Snappy                  |
|0xCF                   |Scaled YCoCg DXT5 |Snappy with options     |

####If the second-stage compression format is None (OxA) or Snappy (0xB):

The header will be four or eight bytes in size and records the size and format of the frame data. The size of the header is determined by the value of the first three bytes.

When the first three bytes of the header each have the value zero, the header is eight bytes in size. The fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth bytes are an unsigned integer. This is the size of the frame data section in bytes.

When any of the first three bytes of the header have a non-zero value, the header is four bytes in size. The first three bytes are an unsigned integer. This is the size of the frame data section in bytes.

####If the second-stage compression format is Snappy with Options (0xC):

The first three bytes will be a bit-field of potential options. Byte four still denotes the S3 and second-stage compression formats. Bytes five through eight are an unsigned integer that denotes the total size of the frame data in bytes. Unless otherwise specified by an option, the frame data will start at byte nine, and the entire frame data can be decoded by a single call to the snappy decompressor. If an unsupported option is detected, decompression should fail. Each option may optionally provide extra header information. Each option's header will be placed in sequence starting at byte nine, in the order that the below table is listed. Each option's header should provide the necessary information to calculate the header's size, unless it is constant size.

|Hexadecimal bit Value |Option                      |
|----------------------|----------------------------|
|0x1                   |Snappy data is partitioned  |

#####Snappy data is partitioned (0x1):

When this option is enabled, the snappy compressed data has been split up into partitions, each of which should be decompressed with a seperate call to the snappy decompressor. Bytes nine through twelve are an unsigned integer denoting the number of compressed partitions. This number also denotes the number of 4-byte unsigned integers that will immediately follow it, each of which denote the compressed size of each partition. The sum of all these sizes must equal the frame size given in bytes five through eight. The full decompressed frame is created by placing each decompressed partition's data in sequence (partition 1's data followed by partition 2's data etc.)

###Frame Data


The remainder of the frame is the frame data, starting immediately after the header. The data is to be treated as indicated by the header. If a second-stage compressor is indicated then the frame data is to be decompressed accordingly. The result of that decompression will be data in the indicated S3 format. If no second-stage compressor is indicated, the frame data is in the indicated S3 format.
